First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Le Duy Tan, for his invaluable guidance and constant encouragement throughout this thesis. His patience and thoughtful feedback have not only shaped my work but also taught me how to approach research with both rigor and creativity. I am truly thankful for his support, which has motivated me to keep moving forward even during challenging times.

I would also like to sincerely thank my family for their unwavering love and support. Their belief in me has been my greatest motivation, giving me strength to overcome obstacles and stay focused on my goals. Words cannot fully express how grateful I am for everything they have done for me.

Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the School of Computer Science and Engineering for providing an academic environment that has allowed me to explore, learn, and grow over the past years.

This thesis is more than just a personal achievement; it reflects the care, guidance, and encouragement I have received from everyone around me. For that, I am deeply grateful.
